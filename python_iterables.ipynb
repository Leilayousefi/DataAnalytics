Advanced iterables
An iterable is anything which may be iterated over, i.e. stepped through one item at a time, such as with a for loop. Iterables contain a number of items which have certain values. For example, the list [1, 8, 5, 16] is an iterable with four items, whose values are 1, 8, 5 and 16.

In the Introduction to Python we met two types of iterables: lists and dictionaries. Strings may be considered a third type, as they can be considered a special type of list whose items are characters. In Part 1 we'll meet two more types: tuples and sets. Part 2 will introduce some of the useful functions Python provides to manipulate, analyse, sort and convert between different types of iterable. Part 3 discusses some important caveats in making copies of iterable data structures, and then Part 4 introduces comprehensions, a powerful way of filtering and reshaping iterables. Finally in Part 5 we discuss a generic type of iterable called an iterator, and how to write generators to define custom iterators.

Part 1. Tuples and sets
Tuples
A tuple is very similar to a list, but it's immutable: once a tuple has been created it cannot be modified, and no new items can be added. Tuples are denoted like a list, but using round brackets instead of square ones, e.g. seasons = ("spring", "summer", "autumn", "winter"). The brackets may in many circumstances be omitted (seasons = "spring", "summer", "autumn", "winter" would work just as well), but it's usually best to put them in for clarity.

So what's the point of them, versus lists? One advantage is better code efficiency: if your code is churning through large numbers of sequences, or has enormous sequences, then tuples are likely to offer performance advantage over lists. Another is that they may be used in some circumstances where a mutable sequence such as a list would not be allowed: for example, a dictionary may use tuples as keys, but cannot use lists.

Task: the function f() below calculates two values a and b. Have it return the values as a tuple; write a line to call the function and read the returned values into variables A and B.


def f():
    a = 365 * 24
    b = a * 3600
     
Solution

def f():
    a = 365 * 24
    b = a * 3600
    return (a, b)

A, B = f()

 
This is a very common way of having a function return more than one value.


Sets
A set contains a number of unique items, i.e. without duplicates. The items in a set may be of any type and, unlike lists and tuples, are not kept in any particular order. Sets are denoted by curly brackets, e.g. pests = {"wasp", "rat", "wasp", "wasp", "cockroach"}. Duplicate entries are ignored, so pests would contain only three items: "wasp", "cockroach" and "rat".

Sets can be added to with .add(), which adds a new item only if it isn't already there, e.g. pests.add("data scientist") would add a new item, but pests.add("rat") would do nothing. Items may be removed with .discard(), which will remove the item if it is present and do nothing otherwise.

The operator & may be used to find items common to two sets, for example if insects = {"fly", "wasp", "beetle", "bee", "cockroach"} then pests & insects would return the set {"cockroach", "wasp"}. Other useful operators are | to find the set of items in one set, the other or both, and - to remove all items in one set from another.

Task: in the box below, find the set of characters which appear in the English aphabet but not the Welsh alphabet, and vice-versa. Notice use of the function set() which is a handy way of generating a set from a list or string.


english = set("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")
welsh = {"a", "b", "c", "ch", "d", "dd", "e", "f", "ff", "g", "ng", "h", "i", "j", "l", "ll", "m", "n", "o", "p", "ph", "r", "rh", "s", "t", "th", "u", "w", "y"}
     
Solution

english = set("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")
welsh = {"a", "b", "c", "ch", "d", "dd", "e", "f", "ff", "g", "ng", "h", "i", "j", "l", "ll", "m", "n", "o", "p", "ph", "r", "rh", "s", "t", "th", "u", "w", "y"}

print(english - welsh)
print(welsh - english)

 

Part 2. Useful functions and methods
Converting between lists, dictionaries, tuples and sets
The functions list(), tuple() and set() can convert any one of these three types into any other. Each can also take a string as an argument, to produce a list, tuple or set of its characters. Note that converting a list, string or tuple to a set will remove any duplicate entries and lose the order of the items.

Calling list(), tuple() or set() on a dictionary will produce a list, tuple or set of the keys of the dictionary. To produce a list of the values the method .values() must be called, for example if digits = {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three"} then list(digits) returns [1, 2, 3] but list(digits.values()) returns ["one", "two", "three"].

Dictionaries may be created from a list, tuple or set in which each item is a length-2 list or tuple, using the dict() function. For example, dict([(1, "one"), (2, "two"), (3, "three")]) would reproduce the dictionary digits above. Lists, tuples or sets in this format may be conveniently generated using the zip() function, which takes as arguments two (or more) lists or tuples and pairs them up into tuples. The zip() function returns something called an iterator, which we'll look at in Part 5, but for now all you need to know is that you can call list(), tuple() or set() on an iterator to produce a list, a tuple or a set. As an example, if a = [1, 2, 3] and b = ["one", "two", "three"], then list(zip(a, b)) returns [(1, "one"), (2, "two"), (3, "three")].

Task: in the box below, fix the error in the tuple english_nums by converting into a list and then changing the erroneous value. Then produce a dictionary having German names of numbers as keys and English names of numbers as values.


english_nums = ("one", "two", "free", "four", "five")
german_nums = {1: "eins", 2: "zwei", 3: "drei", 4: "vier", 5: "funf"}
     
Solution

english_nums = ("one", "two", "free", "four", "five")
german_nums = {1: "eins", 2: "zwei", 3: "drei", 4: "vier", 5: "funf"}

english_list = list(english_nums)
english_list[2] = "three"

german_list = list(german_nums.values())

german_to_english = dict(zip(german_list, english_list))
print(german_to_english)

 

Miscellaneous useful functions and methods
Python contains a number of useful functions and methods for manipulating and analysing lists and other iterables. Here are a few of them:

len(iterable) returns the number of items in a list, tuple, set, dictionary or string.

min(iterable) and max(iterable) return the minimum or maximum value in a list, tuple, set or string. If called on a dictionary, they return the minimum or maximum key. These functions produce an error if called on an empty iterable.

sum(iterable) returns the sum of values within a numeric list, tuple or set. If called on a dictionary, it returns the sum of the keys. This will raise an error if there any non-numeric values.

iterable.count(value) returns the number of items in a list, tuple or string having the value value. For example if rota = ["Sven", "Derek", "Ashleigh", "Derek", "Derek", "Olivia", "Derek"] then rota.count("Derek") would return 4.

iterable.index(value) returns the index in a list, tuple or string at which the first item having value value can be found. Use with caution, as this will produce an error if value is not to be found within the iterable.

list.insert(index, value) inserts a new item of value value into a list at position index.

list.remove(value) removes an item from a list having value value. If there are multiple occurences, it removes the first. If value doesn't appear in the list it will raise an error, so use with caution. Also works on sets, but usually it's best to use the .discard() method for sets, as this will not raise an error if the value is not present.

Task: in the box below, use the functions and methods above to calculate the mean of the values. Then delete the lowest value from the list.


scores = [7.6, 5.7, 8.0, 9.1, 8.4, 3.2, 6.4, 7.9, 5.6, 6.0, 5.5]
     
Solution

scores = [7.6, 5.7, 8.0, 9.1, 8.4, 3.2, 6.4, 7.9, 5.6, 6.0, 5.5]

print(sum(scores) / len(scores))

scores.remove(min(scores))
print(scores)
 

Generating ranges
range() is a useful function for generating sequences of numbers. range() with a single argument produces a sequence of integers from 0 up to (but not including) the argument, for example list(range(5)) returns [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. If there are two arguments a start and stop can be specified, e.g. list(range(2, 5)) returns [2, 3, 4]. A third argument can be used to specify an increment other than one, e.g. list(range(2, 20, 5)) returns [2, 7, 12, 17].

Task: in the box below, use len(), range() and a for loop to populate the dictionary digits so that digits == {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three"}.


number_names = ("one", "two", "three")
digits = {}
     
Solution

number_names = ("one", "two", "three")
digits = {}

for i in range(len(number_names)):
    digits[i+1] = number_names[i]

print(digits)
 
Ther's also a handy function called enumerate() which can do this more concisely:


number_names = ("one", "two", "three")
digits = dict(enumerate(number_names, start=1))
print(digits)
 

Sorting lists
Lists may be sorted using the sorted() function or the .sort() method. These work similarly, but the .sort() method modifies the original list whereas the sorted() function leaves the original list untouched and returns a sorted copy.

By default, lists are sorted numerically (for numeric values), or alphabetically (for strings). For example, if trees = ["oak", "hawthorn", "birch", "willow"] then sorted(trees) returns ["birch", "hawthorn", "oak", "willow"]. However the argument key may be set to any function to sort the list by. For example, sorted(trees, key=len) would sort by string length and return ["oak", "birch", "willow", "hawthorn"].

Quite often when sorting lists we don't have a pre-defined function to sort by, and need to create a temporary sorting function. This can be done with the lambda keyword. For example, to sort the list by the third letter of each tree: sorted(trees, key = lambda x: x[2]) returns ["oak", "willow", "birch", "hawthorn"]. The code lambda x: x[2] creates a temporary function that takes one argument x and returns x[2].

The list can be sorted in descending order by setting the argument reverse to True. E.g. sorted(trees, reverse=True) returns ["willow", "oak", "hawthorn", "birch"].

Lists may be easily reversed using the .reverse() method, which modifies the original, or by using the reversed() function, which leaves the original untouched and returns an iterator of the reversed list. Calling list(reversed(trees)) returns ["willow", "birch", "hawthorn", "oak"]

Task: sort the list below by the number of unique letters in each word (e.g. lists has four unique letters: l, i, s and t).


words = ["rhythmic", "banana", "quintessential", "abracadabra", "spit", "dodo", "anagrams"]
     
Solution

words = ["rhythmic", "banana", "quintessential", "abracadabra", "spit", "dodo", "anagrams"]

words = sorted(words, key = lambda x: len(set(x)))

print(words)
 

Part 3. Shallow and deep copies
Consider the code below.


list1 = [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]
list2 = list1
list2.append(21)
print(list1)
     
Running the code gives a perhaps surprising result. The value 21 has been appended to list1, even though we appended it to list2. This is because both variables refer to the same list. The code list2 = list1 does not create a new copy of the list in memory, it just creates a new reference linking to the same list.

If we want to make an independent copy of a list (or set, tuple or dictionary... we'll just say "list" for the rest of this section for brevity) we need to use the .copy() method, which returns a duplicate copy in memory.

Task: modify the code above so that appending to list2 does not also append to list1.

Solution

list1 = [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]
list2 = list1.copy()
list2.append(21)
print(list1)
 
Things get more complicated when the list we want to copy itself contains other lists. The .copy() method will only create a duplicate in memory of the outer or high-level list; the lists nested within will not be duplicated. This is known as a shallow copy. It means that any changes made to lists nested within the new copy will also affect the old copy. Another method, .deepcopy(), performs a deep copy of the list, creating a duplicate in memory of not only the high-level list but any sub-lists, sub-sub-lists, etc.

Task: modify the code below so that the dictionary dict2 is a shallow copy of dict1 and see how it affects the output. Then try making it a deep copy and see again.


dict1 = {"linear": [1,2,3,4,5],
         "triangle": [1,3,6,10,15],
         "square": [1,4,9,16,25]}
dict2 = dict1
dict2["cube"] = [1,8,27,64,125]
dict2["square"].append(36)
print(dict1)
     
Solution

dict1 = {"linear": [1,2,3,4,5],
         "triangle": [1,3,6,10,15],
         "square": [1,4,9,16,25]}
dict2 = dict1.copy()
dict2["cube"] = [1,8,27,64,125]
dict2["square"].append(36)
print(dict1)
 
This is a shallow copy. The new entry "cube" is not added to dict1 since this is an addition to the high-level dictionary, but the value of "square" in dict1 is updated with a new item since this is an addition to a sub-list which was not duplicated in memory.


dict1 = {"linear": [1,2,3,4,5],
         "triangle": [1,3,6,10,15],
         "square": [1,4,9,16,25]}
dict2 = dict1.deepcopy()
dict2["cube"] = [1,8,27,64,125]
dict2["square"].append(36)
print(dict1)
 
This is a deep copy. Nothing within dict1 is modified by changes to dict2.


Part 4. Comprehensions
A list comprehension is a handy way to make a new list based on on existing list. Here's an example: say we have a list numbers = [1, 8, 3, 5, 1, 2] and we want a new list with those values squared. We could do that with a for loop, but there's a much easier way with a list comprehension: [x**2 for x in numbers], which returns the list [1, 64, 9, 25, 1, 4]. A list comprehension follows the basic format [A for B in C]. It takes each item in turn from C (a list or other iterable) and performs the function A on it, writing the results to a new list. B is a arbitrary label that can be used in A to refer to each item's value.

Task: in the box below, generate a list of powers of two from 2^1 to 2^10 using a list comprehension.



     
Solution

powers_of_two = [2**x for x in range(1, 11)]
print(powers_of_two)
 
More than one label B may be used if the items of the list C are themselves tuples or lists. For example, if magpies = [(1,"sorrow"), (2,"joy"), (3,"a girl"), (4,"a boy")], then [str(count) + " for " + word for count, word in magpies] returns ["1 for sorrow", "2 for joy", "3 for a girl", "4 for a boy"].

Task: given the lists of x and y coordinates in the box below, use zip() and a list comprehension to build a list of distances of the six points (x,y) from the point (2,7).


from math import sqrt

xcoords = [7,  0,  2, 8, -1, 19]
ycoords = [0, 12, -5, 2, -5,  9]
     
Solution

from math import sqrt

xcoords = [7,  0,  2, 8, -1, 19]
ycoords = [0, 12, -5, 2, -5,  9]

dists = [sqrt((y-7)**2 + (x-2)**2) for x,y in zip(xcoords, ycoords)]

print(dists)
 

Conditions in comprehensions
List comprehension can be made more complex by putting conditions inside them. Putting if and a conditions after part C of the comprehension means that only items satisfying that condition will be passed to part A. For example, if digits = [7, 3, 5, 2, 0, 8, 16, 13, 4, 5, 9, 6] then [x for x in digits if not x % 2] would return [2, 0, 8, 16, 4, 6], i.e. only the even numbers. This is a convenient way to filter lists.

Task: use a list comprehension to filter the "NA" values out of the list below.


beatles = ["John", "Paul", "George", "NA", "Ringo", "NA"]
     
Solution

beatles = ["John", "Paul", "George", "NA", "Ringo", "NA"]

beatles = [x for x in beatles if x != "NA"]
print(beatles)
 
You can also use an if and else after part A of the comprehension to give conditional output. For example, to create a list holding values True or False based on whether the values in digits above are even or not, we could use the comprehension [False if x % 2 else True for x in digits].

Task: use a list comprehension to make a list holding the inverse (1/x) of the numbers in digits. To avoid a divide-by-zero error, the list should contain the string "NA" corresponding to the zero.


digits = [7, 3, 5, 2, 0, 8, 16, 13, 4, 5, 9, 6]
     
Solution

digits = [7, 3, 5, 2, 0, 8, 16, 13, 4, 5, 9, 6]

inverse_digits = [1/x if x else "NA" for x in digits]
print(inverse_digits)
 

Dictionary, tuple and set comprehensions
So far we've just considered list comprehensions, but dictionaries, tuples and sets may be generated through comprehensions in a similar way. Here are some examples:

{x:x**2 for x in range(5)} generates the dictionary {0:0, 1:1, 2:4, 3:9, 4:16};
{x.lower() for x in {"RED", "Amber", "green", "amber", "red", "Red"}} generates the set {"red", "amber", "green"};
(x / 2 for x in range(5)) doesn't generate a tuple, but a generator (see next section). To generate the tuple (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2) using a comprehension it would need to be converted using the tuple() function, i.e. tuple(x / 2 for x in range(5)).
Task: use a comprehension to create a dictionary whose keys are the fruits in the list below, and whose values are the number of times each fruit occurs in the list. Do not include snozberries in your dictionary.


fruits = ["apple", "pear", "banana", "snozberry", "pineapple", "banana", "apple",
    "banana", "snozberry", "kiwi", "pear", "banana", "banana", "pineapple",
    "apple", "banana", "banana", "snozberry"]
     
Solution

fruits = ["apple", "pear", "banana", "snozberry", "pineapple", "banana", "apple",
    "banana", "snozberry", "kiwi", "pear", "banana", "banana", "pineapple",
    "apple", "banana", "banana", "snozberry"]

fruit_counts = {fruit:fruits.count(fruit) for fruit in set(fruits) if fruit != "snozberry"}
print(fruit_counts)
 

Part 5. Iterators and generators
Iterators
An iterator is something which returns the values of a sequence one by one when instructed to. Iterators can be created by calling the function iter() on any iterable, and return a value when the function next() is called upon them. For example, the expression it = iter([1, 2, 3, 7]) creates an iterator called it. When next(it) is called it will return the value 2. Subsequent calls of next(it) will return the values 2, 3 and 7.

Iterators may be used in for loops, e.g. for i in it: print(i) would print 1, 2, 3 and 7. They may also be used in comprehensions: [2 * x for x in it] would return the list [2, 4, 6, 14].

An iterator remembers where it is in the sequence. For example, consider this code


nums = [1, 2, 3, 7]
iterator = iter(nums)

print("First two values:")
print(next(iterator), next(iterator))

print("All the values:")
for item in iterator:
    print(item)
     
which produces the following output:


First two values:
1, 2
All the values:
3
7
 
because the iterator, when the for loop calls it, has already returned its first two values. If we wish to refresh the sequence then we need to reinitialise the iterator with a new iter() call.

Generators
A generator is a special type of iterator which can be used to define custom sequences. A generator acts just like an iterator.

We've already met one way of producing a generator in a previous section: through a comprehension in round brackets. For example gen = (x for x in [1, 2, 3, 7]) produces a generator functionally similar to the iterator it above. Another way, however, is by using a generator function containing a yield statement. Here's an example:


def osc5():
    i = 0
    inc = 1
    while True:
        yield i
        i += inc
        if i == 5: inc = -1
        elif i == 0: inc = 1
     
Calling gen = osc5() produces a generator such that repeated calls to next(gen) return 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc. Every time next() is called the function runs through until it hits a yield statement, when it returns a value and pauses until next() is called again.

This generator has a property which lists, tuples etc. cannot have: it is infinite. Infinite generators can be useful, but should be used with caution: calling list(), for example, on an infinite generator would cause a crash. And if you loop through an infinite generator in a for loop you'll need to have a break statement to get out or it'll go on forever.

Task: write a generator function to yield the values of the Fibonacci sequence, then print the first ten values using a for loop. Then use another for loop to print all the values below 100. The Fibonacci sequence has first two values 0 and 1, then subsequent values are the sum of the previous two.



     
Solution

def fib():
    val_older = 0
    val_old = 1
    yield 0
    yield 1
    while True:
        val_new = val_old + val_older
        yield val_new
        val_older = val_old
        val_old = val_new

gen = fib()
for i in range(10):
    print(next(gen))

for i in fib():
    if i >= 100: break
    print(i)
